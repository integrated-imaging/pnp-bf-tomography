MBIR Code for Bright Field electron tomography with anomaly (Bragg) 
modeling, dosage and noise parameter estimation

Based on the paper:

Singanallur V. Venkatakrishnan, Lawrence F.Drummy, Marc De Graef, P. 
Jeff Simmons, Charles A. Bouman, "Model Based Iterative 
Reconstruction for Bright Field Electron Tomography", SPIE Electronic Imaging 2013 
[Note: A modified and more detailed version is currently 
being submitted to the IEEE transactions on Image Processing]

Before compiling code please read CmdlineREADME.txt
in Source/ and install the relevant packages

Directory Structure

Data - A simulated data set of spheres
Example - A shell script to use the data set in Data/
         to reconstruct a small volume and write the results to 
         Results/ folder
Results - Folder containg the expected .rec files from 
          running the script in example
Source - Top level folder containing source C++ code

Brief Instructions

* Compiling needs cmake, boost, Intel TBB (and QT for the GUI).
Read more in CmdlineREADME.txt in Source/ for instructions on compiling. 

* After compiling cd into the Example folder and run the script

* Compare the results of the run with the RefRecon.rec file to ensure
the code is running correctly.
